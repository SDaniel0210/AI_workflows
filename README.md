# AI Workflows – ComfyUI Pipelines

Practical AI workflow engineering for modern generative systems.

---

## About

This repository contains structured ComfyUI workflow exports focused on real-world AI pipeline design rather than model storage.

Modern generative models are too large for Git repositories. This project instead emphasizes:

- Pipeline architecture
- Node graph orchestration
- Conditioning logic
- GPU-aware design
- Modular workflow reuse
- Refinement and upscaling strategies

---

## Design Principles

The workflows in this repository are built with the following priorities:

- **Modularity** – Reusable and composable node structures
- **Efficiency** – Optimized for 12GB VRAM constraints
- **Reproducibility** – Version-controlled pipeline logic
- **Scalability** – Multi-stage refinement capability
- **Hardware awareness** – Designed for local CUDA inference

---

## Core Workflow Areas

- Image generation pipelines
- Background removal flows
- Latent upscaling workflows
- Multi-stage refinement setups
- 3D-related experimental pipelines
